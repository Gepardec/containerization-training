== Containerization basics

=== Discussion running containers

What assurances would you need to run a process on an arbitrary host? Consider

* Hostile environments
* Required resources

=== Learning objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to

* Describe what a container is in terms of processes and isolation tools
* Use the key commands for interacting with Docker containers

=== Containers are processes

[.keyword]#Containers# are processes sandboxed by

* Kernel namespaces
* Control Groups
* Root priviledge management & syscall restrictions (Linux)
* VM isolation (Windows)

=== Linux kernel namespaces

* DEFAULT
** Process IDs
** Network stacks
** inter-process communications
** Mount points
** Hostnames

* OPTIONAL
** User IDs

=== Linux PID kernel namespace

=== Optional Linux isolation features

* Control groups: limit memory & CPU
* Root priviledge management: acceptlist root powers
* System call management: acceptlist available system calls
* Linux Security Modules: mandatory filesystem access control

=== Container logs

* STOUD and STERR for a container process
* `docker container logs <container_name>`

=== Container basics takeaways

* Single process constrained by kernel namespaces, control groups and other Linux technologies
* Private & ephemeral filesystem and data
