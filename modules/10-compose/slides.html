                <li>Docker provides a number of fundamental tools for approaching the problem of orchestration natively from Docker, and the first of these tools is Compose.</li>

        <h2>Discussion: Processes vs. Applications</h2>

        <p>Containers and images describe individual processes. What will we need to describe entire applications?</p>

        <aside class='notes'>
            <ul>
                <li>Lead class to the simple answer (some sort of manifest file that describes the application, in the spirit of deploy scripts or infrastructure-as-code), as well as the more substantial answer of some way to manage a living application, where 'manage' in this context means scale, route traffic, deploy and upgrade.</li>
                <li>Hint questions if the class is stuck:</li>
                <li>It's not enough just to 'describe' an application - we need to make the deployment of those applications reproducible and portable. How? (someone should think of some sort of script).</li>
                <li>Are applications static after they're launched? What if load changes? (leads to thinking about scaling).</li>
                <li>After scaling an application, how do we make sure traffic gets to the new instances of our app? Re-do service discovery? Reconfigure load balancers? We'd rather have something a little more transparent.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Applications consisting of one or more containers across one or more nodes</li>
            <li>Docker Compose facilitates multi-container design <span class='keyword'>on a single node</span></li>

            <ul>
                <li>At this point, we've seen that Docker can provide adequately portable and isolated containers, and we've seen some basic nuts and bolts regarding how those containers can be networked together; we're now ready to start exploring our first orchestration tool for making a true distributed application.</li>
                <li>Ultimately, we'll want to be able to completely decentralize our application, be networking many containers together across many hosts; for now, we'll just solve half the problem, by making an application out of many containers, still all on the same host. We'll relax the single-host constraint in the next chapter.</li>

        <h2>Docker Services</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Goal: declare and (re)configure many similar containers all at once</li>
                <li>Goal: scale apps by adding containers seamlessly</li>
                <li>A <span class='keyword'>service</span> defines the <span class='keyword'>desired state</span> of a group of identically configured containers</li>
                <li>Docker provides <span class='keyword'>transparent service discovery</span> for Services</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class='notes'>
                <ul>
                    <li>So far, we've declared containers one at a time with `docker container run...`, and we've seen how to network individual containers together. This all works, but doesn't scale conveniently.</li>
                    <li>Since we're going to start designing apps to consist of potentially many containers, we'd like to be able to create and reconfigure containers en masse.</li>
                    <li>Furthermore, we need to put some thought into how discovery will work in this paradigm; if we scale up an app by declaring more containers, how will they all find out about each other and network themselves together</li>
                    <li>To address this problem, Docker orchestration introduces the idea of services. A service defines the desired state of a collection of identically configured containers, allowing us to declare a batch of containers all at once, and reconfigure them later by updating the service definition.</li>
                    <li>Furthermore, Docker provides out-of-the-box service discovery for services, automatically providing and configuring the networking necessary for these groups of containers to interact.</li>

        <h2>Service Discovery</h2>

        <img src='images/service-not-process.png' style='width:90%'></img>
        <p>Services are assigned a <span class='keyword'>Virtual IP</span> which spreads traffic out across the underlying containers automatically.</p>

        <aside class='notes'>
            <ul>
                <li>Formerly, we may have had individual processes or containers communicating directly; this isn't practical for a service we want to scale into many processes on demand.</li>
                <li>To address this, Docker assigns a virtual IP to every service, and maintains a DNS lookup table on the host, so that at the application logic level, traffic can be directed to a service as a whole; load balancing to the underlying containers is handled by Docker's onboard VIP server.</li>
                <li>In this way, we can change the number of containers provisioned by a service without needing to do any explicit service discovery in our applications; the application logic sends traffic to the service regardless of how many containers it has provisioned, and Docker does the rest.</li>
