        <h2>Discussion: Provisioning Filesystems</h2>

                <li>Obvious answer: disk and bandwidth usage</li>
                <li>Hint questions if the class is stuck:</li>
                <li>Are all container filesystems necessarily unique? If two containers share a filesystem, how will they remain independent? (leads to layer sharing and read-only images)</li>
                <li>What's a simple way to minimize the risk of vulnerable components making it onto your production servers via a Docker image? (answer: don't install any component you don't absolutely need, indicates the logic of minimal images)</li>
                <li>If containers and their filesystems are meant to move across environments like dev, testing, staging and prod without needing to be modified, how can they reflect the important differences between those environments? (leads to motivating multi-stage builds)</li>

                <li>When a container edits a file from the base image, then and only then is that file copied to the R/W layer; this is what is meant by Docker's 'copy on write' filesystem; this also implies that the copy of a file that is visible in a running container is whichever copy of that file sits highest in the stack of filesystem layers.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>When creating a container on Linux, a R/W container layer is created, and all these filesystem layers are composed via a union filesystem mount. This assembles the image layers into a unified filesystem similar to superimposing a stack of overhead transparencies on top of each other; files on higher layers obscure earlier versions of themselves on lower layers.</li>
                <li>When a container modifies a file from the image, it performs the same copy on write action as above, into the R/W container layer.</li>

                <li>On the Windows side, making union file systems backwards compatible with NTFS wasn't feasible.</li>
                <li>Instead, Windows uses reparse points to effectively link the appropriate image files into a container layer; if a file is unmodified in the layer, a stub is created for it containing the reparse point. Actually, each image layer also contains reparse points to earlier reparse points, in a chain down to the original file.</li>
                <li>When a Windows container changes a file in an image, it's copied to the virtual hard drive where the changes can be made.</li>

                <li>Now that we've seen the basics of image construction with Dockerfiles, we'd like to investigate best practices around image construction</li>
                <li>Our priorities for image creation are size, security, and build times.</li>
                <li>Size and security can be addressed by similar techniques; making sure we only install things we absolutely need in our image not only keeps the image size down, but avoids exposing ourselves to potential vulnerabilities in superfluous components.</li>
                <li>Also during the course of development, we'd like build times to be as fast as possible, either by leveraging the cache we've already seen, or by parallelizing parts of the build process.</li>
                <li>For the next part of this chapter, we'll look at some advanced techniques for achieving all of these.</li>

        <h2>Image Construction Best Practices</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Start with official images</li>
            <li>Use multi-stage builds to drop compilers, SDKs...</li>
            <li>More layers leverage the cache...</li>
            <li>...but fewer layers perform better.</li>

        <aside class='notes'>
            <ul>
                <li>Now that we have the mechanics of making Dockerfiles, there's also a number of optional best practices to consider.</li>
                <li>Base your images off of official images whenever possible; you can recognize these on Docker Hub as they don't have an explicit namespace like vendor/product; they're just single-word names, possibly with a tag. These are all battle-tested images produced in collaboration between the product vendors and Docker, and are scanned regularly for security vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Take advantage of multi-stage builds; these allow you to drop unnecessary layers, which will result in faster container start times, and less components that potentially inject vulnerabilities into your containers.</li>
                <li>Deciding how many layers to build an image out of depends on your priorities. The fundamental tension is that more layers leverage the cache better (since hopefully you don't invalidate the cache until you're most of the way through your Dockerfile), but this creates more overhead at container runtime, which you may wish to avoid for production images.</li>

                <pre class='large'>
docker container run -d --name demo mytallimage:1.0
docker container export demo > image.tar
cat image.tar | docker image import - myflatimage:1.0</pre>

            <li>Combine <code>container export</code> with <code>--squash</code> for one shareable base layer + one application-specific upper layer</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class='notes'>
            <ul>
                <li>Once it's time to go to production (or even to start CI/CD), we don't care so much about build times and caching. The image is nominally built - what matters is performance.</li>
                <li>One way to compress everything into a single layer is to export a container as a tarball, and reimport it as a new, single layer image. This completely destroys the ability of containers to share layers, though</li>
                <li>Another method is the experimental squash flag, which combines all non-base layers into a single layer. Now the base layer remains sharable, and our production image is only two layers.</li>
                <li>One technique for getting the best of both worlds when layer sharing is important is to use the first method to collapse all widely shared layers into a common base image, and then use the --squash flag on subsequent builds to squash the application-unique layers into a single application layer.</li>

                <li>When revving an image, don't just apply patches on top of old images. If it's your base layer that's been revved, the vendor will likely release a new image corresponding to the new software version; update your Dockerfile and rebuild your image with the new base layer.</li>
                <li>The same logic holds true for updating other image layers; rebuild your image from its Dockerfile, pulling in the desired versions of your dependencies, rather than just installing patches on top of patches like you would for software installed on the host.</li>
                <li>Remember copy on write: when you apply a patch, it doesn't overwrite whatever its upgrading; all versions of all files are persisted in their entirety in an ever-growing image layer stack. This will bloat your images and slow down their performance.</li>
