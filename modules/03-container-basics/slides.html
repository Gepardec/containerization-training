        <p>What assurances would you need to run a process on an arbitrary host? Consider</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hostile environments</li>

                <li>Guide the class to thinking about the need for process isolation (via kernel namespaces etc), filesystem provisioning (via Docker images), and resource consumption limitations (via cgroups)</li>
                <li>Hint questions if the class is stuck:</li>
                <li>Do you trust the other processes running on this host? Should they trust you? (leads to need for process isolation)</li>
                <li>Will your process' dependencies be available on this host? Are you sure? (leads to need for docker images)</li>
                <li>How much resources can you reasonably consume on this host? (leads to need for cgroup limitations)</li>

                <li>On a high level the architectures of Linux and Windows are not really that much different. Both rely on fundamental kernel features for creating containers like kernel namespaces and control groups.</li>
                <li>On the Linux side, a container runtime such as containerd uses these kernel features to create and run containers.</li>
                <li>On the Windows side, Microsoft has introduced the Compute Service to abstract the low level details of the capabilities like control groups, namespaces and layer capabilities and not make them (yet) public so that the Windows team can quickly iterate on those features without breaking any external contracts. In this regard Compute Service is the public interface the Docker platform communicates with.</li>
                <li>As said, this is a public API and thus not only Docker is using it but there exists multiple bindings, e.g. for C# and for Go (which is used by Docker).</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The baseline tool for creating containers is the kernel namespace. Kernel namespaces create distinct representations of things like PID trees, user spectra, network stacks and mount points; processes live in exactly one namespace, and are only able to interact with the broader system via the representation encapsulated therein.</li>
                <li>By analogy: an un-namespaced system is like when airplanes used to have just one TV in the cabin everyone would look up at to watch the in-flight movie. Everyone shared the device, and everyone saw the same thing.</li>
                <li>Introducing namespaces is like putting seatback TVs in front of every passenger. Now everyone has their own private devices and sees their own thing, which is hidden from their neighbors.</li>
                <li>In the same way, a namespaced process has all their own resources - their own iptables rules and eth0 device, their own mount points, their own PID tree - and processes in other namespaces aren't allowed to touch or even see these resources.</li>

        <h2>Linux PID Kernel Namespace</h2>

        <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
                <li>For example, PID namespaces make the first process in the namespace appear as the root of a process tree to all other processes in that namespace, which will be its children.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, processes in the parent namespace see these processes with PID numbers like any other process in the parent PID namespace.</li>
                <li>In this way, processes in the child namespace aren't able to find information about processes in the parent namespace, but the child namespace remains transparent from the perspective of the parent namespace.</li>
                <li>Stopping the PID 1 of a child namespace and stopping the container are the exact same thing.</li>
                <li>Isolating host system resources, rather than creating a whole new virtual machine, is where the high performace of containers comes from. Think of it like building a little wall around a patch of sand in a sandbox; the area marked off can itself be thought of as a new sandbox, but no new sand has been acquired.</li>

            <li>In addition to the default kernel namespaces, a number of other linux technologies can be imposed on your containers to restrict their privileges.</li>
            <li>All production deployments should take advantage of control groups, to limit how much memory and CPU a container can consume.</li>
            <li>Root privileges and system calls are governed by whitelist, which can be configured per-container</li>
            <li>Linux security modules allow the creation of access control rules for filesystem paths and objects within the container.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Windows Containers can share the same Windows Kernel of the underlying Windows OS (either Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10).</li>
                <li>A fundamental difference between Linux and Windows containers is the infrastructure they require to make low-level calls to the kernel. In Linux, a container will have a single application process, which can simply issue system calls. But in Windows, a small collection of system processes are required alongside the application process to provide the same functionality; just as these system processes run in uncontainerized user mode, they must also be available inside a windows container.</li>
                <li>The implementation details of Windows containers are fundamentally different than those of linux containers, but they mimic the functionality and isolation provided by kernel namespaces and control groups.</li>
                <li>Microsoft has done and continues to do a lot of tremendous work to minimize this overhead, particularly with Nanoserver.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Windows containers alone don't have a set of isolation tools analogous to root privilege management or linux security modules.</li>
                <li>This has led to Hyper-V Containers. Hyper-v containers are Windows Containers that are wrapped inside a very special and slim VM. This means that from a developers or DevOps perspective nothing changes. These containers are built the exact same way as normal Windows containers and it is merely a switch in the `docker container run` command which determines in which mode the container should run.</li>
                <li>Hyper-V Containers provide all the security and isolation to a single container that we are used to when using VMs to isolate our applications. Yet due to special optimizations Hyper-V containers are much leaner and faster than traditional VMs and thus can be packed much more densely on a server.</li>
                <li>Hyper-V containers have one workload and deliver added isolation for multi-tenant or hostile environments</li>
                <li>The isolation provided by hyper-v containers provides a Windows alternative to the added isolation provided by linux security modules and root privilege management on the Linux side.</li>

                <li>The container lifecycle always begins in the CREATED state. A container in this state has a private filesystem set up on disk (more on this in the next chapter) and metadata defined regarding what process it is to encapsulate and how, but it not yet running. When the process in question begins running, the container transitions to the UP state.</li>
                <li>If a containerized process exits, the container transitions to the EXITED state. It can normally be restarted with a start command.</li>
                <li>Finally, Docker containers can enter a PAUSED state of suspension imposed by control group freezing. This suspension technique (unlike using SIGSTOP and SIGCONT) can't be caught by the process, ensuring that pausing a container doesn't disrupt the process it containerizes.</li>
