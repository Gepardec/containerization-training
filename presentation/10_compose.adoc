== Introduction to container compose

=== Discussion: Processes vs. applications

Containers and images describe individual processes. +
What will we need to describe entire applications?

[.notes]
--
* Lead class to the simple answer (some sort of manifest file that describes the application, in the spirit of deploy scripts or infrastructure-as-code), as well as the more substantial answer of some way to manage a living application, where 'manage' in this context means scale, route traffic, deploy and upgrade.
* Hint questions if the class is stuck:
* It's not enough just to 'describe' an application - we need to make the deployment of those applications reproducible and portable. How? (someone should think of some sort of script).
* Are applications static after they're launched? What if load changes? (leads to thinking about scaling).
* After scaling an application, how do we make sure traffic gets to the new instances of our app? Re-do service discovery? Reconfigure load balancers? We'd rather have something a little more transparent.

=== Learning objectives

By the end of this module, trainees will be able to

* Design scalable Docker services
* Leverage Docker's built in service discovery mechanism
* Write a compose file describing an application

=== Distributed application architecture

* Applications consisting of one or more containers across one or more nodes
* Docker Compose facilitates multi-container design [.keyword]#on a single node#

[.notes]
--
* At this point, we've seen that Docker can provide adequately portable and isolated containers, and we've seen some basic nuts and bolts regarding how those containers can be networked together; we're now ready to start exploring our first orchestration tool for making a true distributed application.
* Ultimately, we'll want to be able to completely decentralize our application, be networking many containers together across many hosts; for now, we'll just solve half the problem, by making an application out of many containers, still all on the same host. We'll relax the single-host constraint in the next chapter.

=== Container services

* Goal: declare and (re)configure many similar containers all at once
* Goal: scale apps by adding containers seamlessly
* A service defines the desired state of a group of identically configured containers
* Docker provides transparent service discovery for Services

[.notes]
--
* So far, we've declared containers one at a time with `docker container run...`, and we've seen how to network individual containers together. This all works, but doesn't scale conveniently.
* Since we're going to start designing apps to consist of potentially many containers, we'd like to be able to create and reconfigure containers en masse.
* Furthermore, we need to put some thought into how discovery will work in this paradigm; if we scale up an app by declaring more containers, how will they all find out about each other and network themselves together
* To address this problem, Docker orchestration introduces the idea of services. A service defines the desired state of a collection of identically configured containers, allowing us to declare a batch of containers all at once, and reconfigure them later by updating the service definition.
* Furthermore, Docker provides out-of-the-box service discovery for services, automatically providing and configuring the networking necessary for these groups of containers to interact.

=== Service discovery

Services are assigned a [.keyword]#Virtual IP# which spreads traffic out across the underlying container automatically.

[.notes]
--
* Formerly, we may have had individual processes or containers communicating directly; this isn't practical for a service we want to scale into many processes on demand.
* To address this, Docker assigns a virtual IP to every service, and maintains a DNS lookup table on the host, so that at the application logic level, traffic can be directed to a service as a whole; load balancing to the underlying containers is handled by Docker's onboard VIP server.
* In this way, we can change the number of containers provisioned by a service without needing to do any explicit service discovery in our applications; the application logic sends traffic to the service regardless of how many containers it has provisioned, and Docker does the rest.

=== Container Compose takeaways

* Docker Compose makes single node orchestration easy
* Compose services makes scaling applications easy
* Bottleneck identification important
* Syntactically: [.keyword]#docker-compose.yml# + API

[.notes]
--
* Compose should be your go-to native Docker solution for orchestrating services and containers on a single node.
* In the next section, we'll learn how to do the same across many nodes.
