== Multi-Stage Builds
By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

* Write a `Dockerfile` that describes multiple images, which can copy files from one image to the next.
* Enable `BuildKit` for faster build times

=== Defining a multi-stage build
Make a new folder named 'multi' to do this exercise in, and cd into it.

Add a file `hello.c` to the multi folder containing Hello World in C:

[source,c++]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    printf ("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
----
Try compiling and running this right on the host OS:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello
[centos@node-0 multi]$ ./hello
----
Now let's Dockerize our hello world application. Add a `Dockerfile` to the multi folder with this content:

[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM alpine:3.5
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --update alpine-sdk
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY hello.c /app
RUN mkdir bin
RUN gcc -Wall hello.c -o bin/hello
CMD /app/bin/hello
----
Build the image and note its size:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker image build -t my-app-large .
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker image ls | grep my-app-large

REPOSITORY     TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
my-app-large   latest   a7d0c6fe0849   3 seconds ago   189MB
----
Test the image to confirm it was built successfully:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker container run my-app-large
----
It should print`hello world`" in the console.

Update your `Dockerfile` to use an AS clause on the first line, and add a second stanza describing a second build stage:

[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM alpine:3.5 AS build
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --update alpine-sdk
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY hello.c /app
RUN mkdir bin
RUN gcc -Wall hello.c -o bin/hello

FROM alpine:3.5
COPY --from=build /app/bin/hello /app/hello
CMD /app/hello
----
Build the image again and compare the size with the previous version:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker image build -t my-app-small .
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker image ls | grep 'my-app-'

REPOSITORY     TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
my-app-small   latest   f49ec3971aa6   6 seconds ago        4.01MB
my-app-large   latest   a7d0c6fe0849   About a minute ago   189MB
----
As expected, the size of the multi-stage build is much smaller than the large one since it does not contain the Alpine SDK.

Finally, make sure the app works:

[source,Dockerfile]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker container run --rm my-app-small
----
You should get the expected `Hello, World!` output from the container with just the required executable.

=== Building Intermediate Images
In the previous step, we took our compiled executable from the first build stage, but that image wasn't tagged as a regular image we can use to start containers with; only the final `FROM` statement generated a tagged image. In this step, we'll see how to persist whichever build stage we like.

Build an image from the build stage in your `Dockerfile` using the `--target` flag:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker image build -t my-build-stage --target build .
----
Notice all its layers are pulled from the cache; even though the build stage wasn't tagged originally, its layers are nevertheless persisted in the cache.

Run a container from this image and make sure it yields the expected result:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker container run -it --rm my-build-stage /app/bin/hello
----
List your images again to see the size of my-build-stage compared to the small version of the app.

=== Optional: Building from Scratch
So far, every image we've built has been based on a pre-existing image, referenced in the `FROM` command. But what if we want to start from nothing, and build a completely original image? For this, we can build `FROM scratch`.

In a new directory ~/scratch, create a file named sleep.c that just launches a sleeping process for an hour:

[source,c++]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
  int delay = 3600; //sleep for 1 hour
  printf ("Sleeping for %d second(s)...\n", delay);
  sleep(delay);
  return 0;
}
----
Create a file named `Dockerfile` to build this sleep program in a build stage, and then copy it to a scratch-based image:

[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM alpine:3.8 AS build
RUN ["apk", "update"]
RUN ["apk", "add", "--update", "alpine-sdk"]
COPY sleep.c /
RUN ["gcc", "-static", "sleep.c", "-o", "sleep"]

FROM scratch
COPY --from=build /sleep /sleep
CMD ["/sleep"]
----
This image will contain nothing but our executable and the bare minimum file structure Docker needs to stand up a container filesystem. 

NOTE: Note we're statically linking the sleep.c binary, so it will have everything it needs bundled along with it, not relying on the rest of the container's filesystem for anything.

Build your image:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 scratch]$ docker image build -t sleep:scratch .
----
List your images, and search for the one you just built:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 scratch]$ docker image ls | grep scratch

REPOSITORY  TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
sleep       scratch   1b68b20a85a8   9 minutes ago   128kB
----
This image is only `128 kB`, as tiny as possible.

Run your image, and check out its filesystem; we can't list directly inside the container, since ls isn't installed in this ultra-minimal image, so we have to find where this container's filesystem is mounted on the host. Start by finding the PID of your sleep process after its running:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 scratch]$ docker container run --name sleeper -d sleep:scratch
[centos@node-0 scratch]$ docker container top sleeper

UID   PID   PPID  C  STIME  TTY  TIME     CMD
root  1190  1174  0  15:21  ?    00:00:00 /sleep
----
In this example, the PID for sleep is 1190.

List your container's filesystem from the host using this PID:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 scratch]$ sudo ls /proc/<PID>/root

dev  etc  proc  sleep  sys
----
We see not only our binary sleep but a bunch of other folders and files. Where does these come from? runC, the tool for spawning and running containers, requires a json config of the container and a root file system. At runtime, Docker Engine adds these minimum requirements to form the most minimal container filesystem possible.

Clean up by deleting your container:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 scratch]$ docker container rm -f sleeper
----

=== Optional: Enabling BuildKit
In addition to the default builder, `BuildKit` can be enabled to take advantages of some optimizations of the build process.

Back in the `~/multi` directory, turn on `BuildKit`:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
----
Add an AS label to the final stage of your Dockerfile (this is not strictly necessary, but will make the output in the next step easier to understand):

[source,Dockerfile]
----
...

FROM alpine:3.5 AS prod
RUN apk update
COPY --from=build /app/bin/hello /app/hello
CMD /app/hello
----
Re-build my-app-small, without the cache:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ docker image build --no-cache -t my-app-small-bk .

----
Notice the lines marked like `[prod 2/3]` and `[build 4/6]`: prod and build in this context are the AS labels you applied to the `FROM` lines in each stage of your build in the `Dockerfile`; from the above output, you can see that the build stages were built in parallel. Every step of the final image was completed while the build environment image was being created; the prod environment image creation was only blocked at the `COPY` instruction since it required a file from the completed build image.

Comment out the `COPY` instruction in the prod image definition in your `Dockerfile`, and rebuild; the build image is skipped. `BuildKit` recognized that the build stage was not necessary for the image being built, and skipped it.

Turn off BuildKit:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 multi]$ export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
----

=== Conclusion
In this exercise, you created a `Dockerfile` defining multiple build stages. Being able to take artifacts like compiled binaries from one image and insert them into another allows you to create very lightweight images that do not include developer tools or other unnecessary components in your production-ready images, just like how you currently probably have separate build and run environments for your software. This will result in containers that start faster, and are less vulnerable to attack.
