== Database Volumes
By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

* Provide a docker volume as a database backing to Postgres
* Recover a Postgres database from volume contents after destroying the original Postgres container

=== Launching Postgres
Download a postgres image, and look at its history to determine its default volume usage:

[source,shell]
----
[user@node ~]$ docker image pull postgres:9-alpine
[user@node ~]$ docker image inspect postgres:9-alpine

...
"Volumes": {
    "/var/lib/postgresql/data": {}
},
...
----
You should see a `Volumes` block like the above, indicating that those paths in the container filesystem will get volumes automatically mounted to them when a container is started based on this image.

Set up a running instance of this postgres container:

[source,shell]
----
[user@node ~]$ docker container run --name some-postgres \
    -v db_backing:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
    -d postgres:9-alpine
----
Notice the explicit volume mount, `-v db_backing:/var/lib/postgresql/data`; if we hadn't done this, a randomly named volume would have been mounted to the container's `/var/lib/postgresql/data`. Naming the volume explicitly is a best practice that will become useful when we start mounting this volume in multiple containers.

=== Writing to the Database
The `psql` command line interface to postgres comes packaged with the postgres image; spawn it as a child process in your postgres container interactively, to create a postgres terminal:

[user@node ~]$ docker container exec \
    -it some-postgres psql -U postgres
Create an arbitrary table in the database:

[source,shell]
----
postgres=# CREATE TABLE PRODUCTS(PRICE FLOAT, NAME TEXT);
postgres=# INSERT INTO PRODUCTS VALUES('18.95', 'widget');
postgres=# INSERT INTO PRODUCTS VALUES('1.45', 'sprocket');
----
Double check you created the table you expected, and then quit this container:

[source,shell]
----
postgres=# SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS;

  price  |  name  
---------+-----------
  18.95  | widget
  1.45   | sprocket
(2 rows)

postgres=# \q
----
Delete the postgres container:

[source,shell]
----
[user@node ~]$ docker container rm -f some-postgres
----
Create a new postgres container, mounting the `db_backing` volume just like last time:

[source,shell]
----
[user@node ~]$ docker container run \
    --name some-postgres \
    -v db_backing:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
    -d postgres:9-alpine
----
Reconnect a `psql` interface to your database, also like before:

[source,shell]
----
[user@node ~]$ docker container exec \
    -it some-postgres psql -U postgres
----
List the contents of the `PRODUCTS` table:

[source,shell]
----
postgres=# SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS;
----
The contents of the database have survived the deletion and recreation of the database container; this would not have been true if the database was keeping its data in the writable container layer. As above, use `\q` to quit from the postgres prompt.

=== Conclusion
Whenever data needs to live longer than the lifecycle of a container, it should be pushed out to a volume outside the container's filesystem; numerous popular databases are containerized using this pattern.
