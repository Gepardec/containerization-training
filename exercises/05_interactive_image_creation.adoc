== Interactive Image Creation
By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

* Capture a container's filesystem state as a new docker image
* Read and understand the output of `docker container diff`

=== Modifying a Container

Start a bash terminal in a CentOS container:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 ~]$ docker container run -it centos:7 bash
----
Install a couple pieces of software in this container - there's nothing special about wget, any changes to the filesystem will do. Afterwards, exit the container:

[source,shell]
----
[root@dfe86ed42be9 /]# yum install -y which wget
[root@dfe86ed42be9 /]# exit
----
Finally, try `docker container diff` to see what's changed about a container relative to its image; you'll need to get the container ID via `docker container ls -a` first:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 ~]$ docker container ls -a
[centos@node-0 ~]$ docker container diff <container ID>

C /root
A /root/.bash_history
C /usr
C /usr/bin
A /usr/bin/gsoelim
...
----
Those `C` 's at the beginning of each line stand for files Changed, and `A` for Added; lines that start with `D` indicate Deletions.

=== Capturing Container State as an Image
Installing which and wget in the last step wrote information to the container's read/write layer; now let's save that read/write layer as a new read-only image layer in order to create a new image that reflects our additions, via the docker container commit:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 ~]$ docker container commit <container ID> myapp:1.0
----
Check that you can see your new image by listing all your images:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 ~]$ docker image ls

REPOSITORY  TAG   IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
myapp       1.0   34f97e0b087b   8 seconds ago   300MB
centos      7     5182e96772bf   44 hours ago    200MB
----
Create a container running bash using your new image, and check that which and wget are installed:

[source,shell]
----
[centos@node-0 ~]$ docker container run -it myapp:1.0 bash
[root@2ecb80c76853 /]# which wget
----
The which commands should show the path to the specified executable, indicating they have been installed in the image. Exit your container when done by typing exit.

=== Conclusion
In this exercise, you saw how to inspect the contents of a container's read / write layer with `docker container diff`, and commit those changes to a new image layer with `docker container commit`. 
Committing a container as an image in this fashion can be useful when developing an environment inside a container, when you want to capture that environment for reproduction elsewhere.
